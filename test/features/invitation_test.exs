  The flow this example exists to show, in a browser.

  Every test here is about a row an instance can hold exactly once — the claim, an invitation that
  is spent by being accepted. Nothing has to clean up between them: Wallaby shares the test's
  sandboxed connection, so each starts from an empty database and rolls back when it ends.
