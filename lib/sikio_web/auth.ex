  The three decisions Ithibati does not make, made here — and this instance makes them narrowly.

  Nobody registers without an invitation, except the first person, who has nobody to invite them.
  Both answers live in `registration_subject/2`, which is asked *before* a challenge is minted: a
  refusal there means no ceremony starts at all, and a token that opens nothing is answered the
  same way as no token.
